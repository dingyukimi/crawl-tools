 
Wand 1 fits everyone, Wand 2,3 only fit the first wizard,and Wand 4 does not fit anyone.So Ollivanders can sell two wands:
sell Wand 1 to Wizard 2 and Wand 2 to Wizard 1,or sell Wand 1 to Wizard 3 and Wand 3 to Wizard 1 ,or some other cases. But 
he cannot sell 3 wands because no 3 wands just fit 3 wizards.
